## Authentication
The API uses JWT token for authentication. The API accepts the token in the
`Authorization` header, in the following format:
`Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ik...0RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ`
This header must be included with every request.

## Obtaining the Access token
You can get JWT token from the OAuth2 token endpoint by setting the `token_type` parameter to `jwt`. **This parameter must be set as HTTP POST parameter.**

The OAuth2 flows are described here:
[Basic Authentication](/api-basics-authentication)

The recommended authentication flow is _Client credentials_.

## Time format
Every time field provided by the API is formatted by ISO8601 format (eg. `2018-07-16T19:20:30+01:00`).
The API also accepts parameters in this format only.

## Terminology
 - *media*: Media is a common word for both live broadcasts and videos
 - *content type*: The API has knowledge of two types of content: live
   broadcast and videos
 - *content id*: A numeric identifier of the media. For Live it means channel id,
   for video it means video id
 - *segment*: A part of the media watched by the user
