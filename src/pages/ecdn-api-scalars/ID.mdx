The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache.
The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable.
When expected as an input type, any string (such as "4") or integer (such as 4) input value will be accepted as an ID.
