## Authorization flows

The OAuth 2.0 protocol provides several flows (workflows) for authorizing a user and obtaining an access token. It depends on the type and architecture of the client which flow is the most suitable. The following flows are supported:

- **Authorization Code:** Suitable for third-party websites which contain a client and a server component.
- **Client Credentials:** Best choice for users developing server-side applications to manage their content / settings.

### Authorization Code flow

1. The user enters its credentials to a secure login webpage.
2. After logging in, the browser is redirected to a special URL (defined by the client), passing an authorization code in the URL.
3. The third-party server obtains the access token with another HTTP request in the background, using the authorization code.

See The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for details.

### Client Credentials flow

Client credentials can be generated on the Video Streaming dashboard. The client obtains an access token using the `client_id` and `client_secret`. With this token the user's server-side application can access the resources of the account which is identified by this client_id/client_secret pair.

## Authorize the user

<Title>Authorization endpoint</Title>

|                        |                                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Location               | https://authentication.video.ibm.com/authorize |
| Supported HTTP methods | GET, POST                                      |
| Supported flows        | Authorization Code                             |

The authorization endpoint is a secure web page that authenticates the user. The client should show this page to the user in an embedded browser. When the user completes the login process, the browser is redirected to a special URL. The client can capture this redirect call, and obtain an authorization code.

### Parameters

The parameters below specify the behavior of the authorization endpoint. They have to be set in GET or POST HTTP parameters.

| ------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `device_name` | string | OPTIONAL   | Full product name of the client device or application. It is used for easy identification of the OAuth 2.0 token. The user will be able to review which clients are connected to his/her account, and revoke these grants on the IBM Video Streaming website. |
| `lang`        | string | OPTIONAL   | Show the authorization page in this locale (e.g. en_US); This parameter will also set the language of the newly registered users.                                                                                                                             |

### Response values

The response values below are appended to the redirect_uri as HTTP GET parameters.

#### Authorization Code flow

If the `response_type` parameter is `code`, the following properties are returned:

| PROPERTY | DESCRIPTION                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code`   | An authorization code (40-character long string)                    |
| `state`  | If state was sent to the endpoint, we send it back                  |

### Error handling

If the authentication was not successful, there is no HTTP redirection: the user can stay on the Authorization Endpoint page until the correct credentials are entered. It is also possible to request a password reset if the password is forgotten.

If the user authenticates correctly, but interrupts the authorization flow, e.g. by pressing a Deny button on the authorization page, the browser is redirected to the redirect_uri with the following parameters:

| NAME  | DESCRIPTION                                        |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| error | `access_denied`                                    |
| state | If state was sent to the endpoint, we send it back |

## Obtain an access token

<Title>Token Endpoint</Title>

|                        |                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Location               | https://video.ibm.com/oauth2/token |
| Supported HTTP methods | POST                               |

### Authorization Code flow

When the client receives the authorization code, the server-side component of the client calls the token endpoint to return the access token.

#### Parameters

The following parameters must be set as HTTP POST parameters:

| PARAMETER      | TYPE   | IMPORTANCE | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grant_type`   | string | REQUIRED   | MUST be `authorization_code` in this case.                                                                     |
| `client_id`    | string | REQUIRED   | 40-character long string, provided by IBM Video Streaming                                                      |
| `code`         | string | REQUIRED   | The authorization code received from the authorization endpoint                                                |
| `redirect_uri` | string | REQUIRED   | The redirection URI used by the authorization server to return the authorization response in the previous step |

The token endpoint currently works for bearer tokens only.

In addition to the parameters above, the client has to provide its client secret (provided along with the client key) to authenticate itself. The authentication is done with HTTP Basic authorization method.

Example HTTP header:

```
Authorization: Basic bc345abc45d6789abcdef0123aef0126789def01
```

#### Success response

The response of the token endpoint is a JSON object.

JSON response on success (for bearer tokens):

| `expires_in`    | Token's current lifetime, in seconds.                                                                                                                                            |

#### Example

The following is an example with the authorization code flow.

1 - The client opens a browser with the authorization endpoint:

```
https://authentication.video.ibm.com/authorize
?response_type=code
&client_id=AAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDDD
&redirect_uri=http://example.com/get_access_token
&device_name=My%20Device
&scope=broadcaster
&state=XYZ
```

2 - The user enters his/her credentials and presses the Allow button. The browser is redirected to the following URL:

```
http://example.com/get_access_token?code=19d8dbb3ebac55f110c3b526e38bcfdfbf46d659&state=XYZ
```

3 - The page handler at http://example.com/get_access_token retrieves the Access Token using the Token Endpoint:

```
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: video.ibm.com
    Authorization: Basic xxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyywwwwwwwwwwzzzzzzzzzz
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=AAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDDD
    &code=19d8dbb3ebac55f110c3b526e38bcfdfbf46d659&redirect_uri=http://example.com/get_access_token

```

4 - The response of token endpoint contains the access token:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Cache-Control: no-store
    Content-Type:application/json; charset=UTF-8
    {"access_token":"ab345cdef123ef1267890abcdef04567890abcd1", "refresh_token":"cb12cdef123ef1267890abcdef04567890abcd1","token_type":"bearer", "expires_in":86400}

```
