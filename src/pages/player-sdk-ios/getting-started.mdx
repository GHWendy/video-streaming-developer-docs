## Introduction

The Ustream Player SDK lets you play Ustream live and recorded videos in your native applications. Using the native SDK gives you full control over the Player, including a customizable native user interface, callbacks on status changes, and many more.

This document describes the basic steps to make a mobile app using the Player SDK for iOS.
