## Overview

Native and mobile apps can not store secrets in a secure way, therefore it’s not recommended to use the standard
authorization code flow, since it requires a client secret when exchanging the authorization code for an access token
on the token endpoint. By selecting the “Native application” option on the Video Streaming dashboard, PKCE
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) protocol can be forced to secure the auth flow. PKCE is a technique for public
clients to mitigate the threat of having the authorization code intercepted. Clients need to create a secret, then use
that secret again when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. This way if the code is intercepted,
the evil application won’t be able to use it because the token request relies on the initial secret.

### Generate a code verifier and code challenge

Apps have to generate a unique code verifier for every authorization request. This value has to be transformed to a
`code_challenge`, which is sent to the authorization server to obtain the authorization code.
A `code_verifier` is a high-entropy cryptographic random string using the unreserved characters
`[A-Z]` / `[a-z]` / `[0-9]` / `-` / `.` / `_` / `~`, with a minimum length of 43 characters and a maximum length of 128 characters.
The code verifier should have enough entropy to make it impractical to guess the value.

<Title>Supported methods for generating a code challenge</Title>

| METHOD  | DESCRIPTION |
| ------- | - |
| `plain` | The code challenge is the same value as the code verifier generated above. `code_challenge` = `code_verifier` |
| `S256`  | The code challenge is the Base64URL (without padding) encoded SHA256 hash of the code verifier. `code_challenge` = `BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))` |

### Send a request to the auth server

To obtain user authorization, send a request to the authorization server at https://authentication.video.ibm.com/authorize. This endpoint handles active session lookup, authenticates the user, and obtains user consent.
The authorization server supports the following additional query string parameters for installed applications:

| PARAMETER               | IMPORTANCE | DESCRIPTION                                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `code_challenge`        | REQUIRED   | Specifies an encoded `code_verifier` that will be used as a server-side challenge during authorization code exchange |
| `code_challenge_method` | OPTIONAL   | Defaults to `plain`. Must be used with `code_challenge`. Supported values: `plain`, `S256` |

### Exchange authorization code for refresh and access tokens

To exchange an authorization code for an access token, call the token endpoint (https://video.ibm.com/oauth2/token) and set the following parameters:

| PARAMETER       | TYPE   | IMPORTANCE | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grant_type`    | string | REQUIRED   | MUST be `authorization_code` in this case.                                                                     |
| `client_id`     | string | REQUIRED   | 40-character long string, provided by IBM Video Streaming                                                      |
| `code`          | string | REQUIRED   | The authorization code received from the authorization endpoint                                                |
| `code_verifier` | string | REQUIRED   | Code verifier that has been created |
| `redirect_uri`  | string | REQUIRED   | The redirect URI used by the authorization server to return the authorization response |

#### Example

The following is an example with the authorization code flow using PKCE.

1 - The client opens a browser with the authorization endpoint:

```
https://authentication.video.ibm.com/authorize
?response_type=code
&client_id=AAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDDD
&redirect_uri=https://example.com/get_auth_code
&scope=broadcaster
&state=XYZ
&code_challenge=bWl6dQ
&code_challenge_method=S256
```

2 - The user enters his/her credentials and presses the Allow button. The browser is redirected to the following URL:

```
http://example.com/get_access_token?code=19d8dbb3ebac55f110c3b526e38bcfdfbf46d659&state=XYZ
```

3 - The page handler at http://example.com/get_access_token retrieves the Access Token using the Token Endpoint:

```
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: video.ibm.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=AAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCDDDDDDDDDD&code=19d8dbb3ebac55f110c3b526e38bcfdfbf46d659&redirect_uri=http://example.com/get_access_token&code_verifier=asdf
```

4 - The response of token endpoint contains the access token:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-store
Content-Type:application/json; charset=UTF-8

{"access_token":"ab345cdef123ef1267890abcdef04567890abcd1","refresh_token":"cb345cdef123ef1267890abcdef04567890abcd1","token_type":"bearer", "expires_in":86400}
```
