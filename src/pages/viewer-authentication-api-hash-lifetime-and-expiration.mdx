Once is successfully validated by IBM Video Streaming, the player will store the hash in the end user’s browser. This lets the viewer watch the video when returning to the page without having authenticate again.

You can specify an expiration date for the hash. When the viewer returns to the page after the expiration date, she has to authenticate again.

Expiration date has to be

- Specified in UNIX timestamp format
- Part of the hash by concatenating it to the rest of the parameters
- Included in the response object as “hashExpire”.
- JSON encoded as part of the response

Example script in PHP for specifying hash expiration date

```js
// We specify an expiration date as a UNIX timestamp
// which is valid for one hour.
$expiration = time()+3600;

// We concatenate it to the rest of the parameters when creating the hash.
$hash = md5(implode('|', $userData).'|'.$expiration.'|'.$SHARED_SECRET_KEY);

// We include it in the response.
$response = array_chunk(
    array_merge($userData, ["hashExpire" => $expiration, "hash" => $hash]),
    1,
    true
);

// We encode the output into JSON format.
$json = json_encode($response);

```

When validating the authentication response the IBM Video Streaming infrastructure checks

- If the expiration is a past date
- If the expiration was hashed properly

This way we can make sure that the expiration date comes from you and it has not been tampered on the client side.
