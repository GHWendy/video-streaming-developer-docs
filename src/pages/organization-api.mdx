## Overview

The Organization API allows the management of various aspects of an Organization.

Every API call need a token associated with a user with **Organization administrator** access level.

There are four groups of calls under the API:

- [Organization Settings](/organization-api/organization-settings): lists Organizations and allows the changing an Organization's name
- [SSO Settings](/organization-api/sso-settings): used to configure the account's SSO login settings under the Organization. Currently two types of SSO providers are supported: Google Apps and SAML based
- [Administrators](/organization-api/administrators): used to manage the Administrators and their Permissions
- [Custom Roles](/organization-api/custom-roles): Other than the built-in roles like Organization Administrator and Channel Administrator you can create Custom Roles and associate permissions to them

## How Organizations, accounts and Channels relate to each other

On IBM Video Streaming a **Channel** is a container for videos. You can upload videos to a Channel or start a broadcast on it.

An **Account** is a set of Channels, and it is associated with a Subscription which makes it easier to measure usages of IBM Video Streaming's resources.

An **Organization** is basically a set of Accounts which makes it easier for a larger company or organization with multiple Accounts to manage users and their permissions.

## Permissions

On IBM Video Streaming there are a couple of predefined Roles.

| NAME                       | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Organization Administrator | Can manage settings and content of an Organization (SSO Settings, administrators, accounts, Channels and videos). You can think an Organization administrator as a "Superuser" in the Organization |
| Account Administrator      | Can manage every settings and content of an account and the Channels and Videos under it                                                                                                           |
| Channel Administrator      | Can manage every settings and content of a Channel and the videos under it                                                                                                                         |

Other than the predefined Roles you can create your own to fine tune the Permissions of Administrators in your Organization. Make sure you read the [Create a custom role](/organization-api/custom-roles#create-a-custom-role) page for further details.
