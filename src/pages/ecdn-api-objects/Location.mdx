A customer's location.

```graphql
type Location {

	# ID of location.
	id: ID!

	# Name of location.
	name: String!

	# Number of servers in location.
	numberOfServers: Int!

	# Servers in location.
	servers: [Server!]!

	# Parent location or region of location.
	parent: LocationsParent!

	# (direct) Child locations of location.
	children: [Location!]!

	# Depth of (deepest possible) child location chain (starting from this location).
	# * A location without any children has children a depth of 0.
	# * A location with a child that doesn't have any children has a depth of 1.
	# * A location that has at least one child with children has a depth of 2.
	childrenDepth: Int!

	# The maximum children depth this location can have. A maximum of 3 locations can be chained
	# together. Therefore if a location:
	# * Is a top-level one, the maximum children depth is 2
	#   (it can have child locations with children).
	# * Has a top-level location as parent: the maximum children depth is 1
	#   (can have children, but they cannot have additional children).
	# * Has a parent location with a parent location: the maximum children depth is 0
	#   (cannot have children, would exceed the overall -3- depth limit).
	childrenDepthLimit: Int!

	# External IP ranges of location.
	externalRanges: [IPv4Range!]!

	# Whether external ranges are inherited from parent location.
	inheritExternalRanges: Boolean!

	# Restriction for client connections. Null if there aren't any restrictions.
	clientRestriction: ClientRestriction

	# Whether clients can connect to servers in this location or not.
	clientConnectionsEnabled: Boolean!

	# Whether clients can fall back to external CDNs or not.
	cdnFallbackEnabled: Boolean!

	# Whether management traffic of servers in location are proxied through parent servers.
	# Video traffic is proxied through parent servers in all cases.
	# Management traffic can only be proxied through ECDN servers (i.e: not through midgress),
	# therefore this can only be enabled in child locations.
	parentProxyEnabled: Boolean!

	# What time was this location created and by whom.
	created: RecordedAction!

	# Last time this location was modified and by whom.
	modified: RecordedAction!
