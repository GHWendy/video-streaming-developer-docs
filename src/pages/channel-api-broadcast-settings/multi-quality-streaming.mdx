## Set multi-quality streaming

By turning this feature on your stream will be transcoded into several versions with different quality settings. For example, a high definition video might have a 720p, 480p and 240p versions created. These can then be used for adaptive bitrate delivery or by allowing the viewer to select a desired quality manually.
